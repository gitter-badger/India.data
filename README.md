India.data helps you visualize and chart Indian Survey data including [OGD](https://data.gov.in)(Open Government Data) without right from your mobile device, without the need of any in-depth knowledge about using CSVs, Excel sheets, etc. The website will provide detailed and interactive maps and charts to infer from the OGD data.

## We already have data.gov.in. Why another data portal?
The Government of India has made a lot of public data available through its data.gov.in portal and made it publicly reusable and accessible to all by following the [Government Open Data License - India](https://data.gov.in/government-open-data-license-india).

For details refer to the [Project Open Canvas](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VW1mZcP9nKQVwNfgyFIiw2fk8GWuK8TKlp9soRZB-Qo/edit#slide=id.p) and the [Project Roadmap](https://github.com/karansapolia/India.data/projects/1)
